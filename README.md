# SADX Quick Restart
### Description
This mod allows you, when pressing L + R, to teleport instantly to the previous checkpoint.
It also lets you save a position by pressing L + LB and then L + R to teleport. Press L + LB again to clear the position. Instead of teleporting, you can do a complete restart (will reload everything) by pressing L + RB.
